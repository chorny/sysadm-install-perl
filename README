NAME
    Sysadm::Install - Typical installation tasks for system administrators

SYNOPSIS
      use Sysadm::Install;

      my $INST_DIR = '/home/me/install/';

      cd($INST_DIR);
      cp("/deliver/someproj.tgz", ".");
      untar("someproj.tgz");
      cd("someproj");
      make("test install");

DESCRIPTION
    Have you ever wished for your installation shell scripts to run
    reproducably, without much programming fuzz, and even with optional
    logging enabled? Then give shell programming, use Perl.

    "Sysadm::Install" executes shell-like commands performing typical
    installation tasks: Copying files, extracting tarballs, calling "make".
    It has a "fail once and die" policy, meticulously checking the result of
    ever operation and calling "die()" immeditatly if anything fails.

  FUNCTIONS
    "cp($source, $target)"
        Copy a file from $source to $target. "target" can be a directory.

    "download($url)"
        Download a file specified by $url and store it under the name
        returned by "basename($url)".

    "untar($tgz_file)"
        Untar the tarball in $tgz_file, which typically adheres to the
        "someproject-X.XX.tgz" convention. But regardless of whether the
        archive actually contains a top directory "someproject-X.XX", this
        function will behave if it had one. If it doesn't have one, a new
        directory is created before the unpacking takes place.

    "mkd($dir)"
        Create a directory of arbitrary depth, just like
        "File::Path::mkpath".

    "rmf($dir)"
        Delete a directory and all of its descendents, just like "rm -rf" in
        the shell.

    "cd($dir)"
        chdir to the given directory.

    "cdback()"
        chdir back to the last directory before a previous "cd".

    "make()"
        Call "make" in the shell.
